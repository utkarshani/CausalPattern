# CausalPattern
The causal pattern is a proposed ontology design pattern for representing the structure and semantics
of causal relations. This pattern is grounded in the concepts defined and used by the CausalAI community,
with Causal Bayesian Networks and do-calculus. The pattern modeled three primary concepts: (1) causal
relations, (2) causal event roles, and (3) causal effect weights.
