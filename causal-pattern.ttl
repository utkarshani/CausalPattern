For example, an effect weight may be a qualitative value, enumerated as {Strong, Middling, Weak}, and represented as an instance of the EffectWeight class. Alternatively, an effect weight may be a quantitative value represented as a numeric literal, perhaps ranging from 0 to 1. For this reason, effect weight is only loosely defined and should be adapted based on the use case. In this case effect weight is represented as a literal." ;
